**`technology enthusiast`**

I'm a lifelong learner who seeks knowledge day by day. Currently I'm a student at [42Rio](https://42.rio/), which is where my journey into programing started. There, I've been learning new concepts, programing languages and practices in the creation of personal projects, while developping my soft skills through the methodology used by 42school, wich forces you to defend and review projects thoroughly and exchange knowledge between your peers.
